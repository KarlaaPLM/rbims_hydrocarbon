# Here you can find two types of data:
- [Genomes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WYs3GdwyHIUmvKre3j58Tp4IQTQGGptn) of the 42 MAGs (to be annotated) in fasta format. The annotation process can be done on your own with [prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) in bash environment.
- [Proteomes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WYs3GdwyHIUmvKre3j58Tp4IQTQGGptn) of the 42 MAGs (already annotated). The data was already been annotated with prokka. These fasta files are ready to be functionally annotated with KEGG and InterProScan.
