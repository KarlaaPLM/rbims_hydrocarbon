# Here you can find two types of data:
- Genomes of the 42 MAGs (to be annotated) in fasta format. The annotation process can be done on your own with [prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) in bash environment.
- Proteomes of the 42 MAGs (already annotated). The data was already annotated with prokka. These files are ready to be functionally annotated with KEGG and InterProScan.
