# MAGs for the data analysis of hydrocarbonâ€‘degrading bacteria. 

In this repository you can find the 42 MAGs used to test rbims and the userguide to replicate our results. The MAGs are submitted under project ID PRJNA816150. 
But you can download the data directly from the directories here displayed. 

- Raw Data: Contains the raw genomes and proteomes, to be functionally annotated outside or within the rbims conda environment.
- Functional annotation: proteomes annotated with KEGG and InterProScan, ready to be used by rbims in R.
